We use a 4-layer page table. All divisions between user/kernel space happen at the highest level table.

0x000 User Space
 ...
0x0FF User Space
0x100 Active PML4 self-mapping
0x101 Secondary PML4 mapping for forking/initialization
0x102 Kernel Heap
 ...
0x1FE Kernel Heap
0x1FF Kernel Heap/Static

The last page is split between heap/Static. It's layout:
0x000 Kernel Heap
 ...
0x1FD Kernel Heap
0x1FE Kernel Static
0x1FF Kernel Static

That is, the highest 2GB are mapped to kernel static code/data.
